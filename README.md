### Memory mapping

### Hello world
The 8 bit computer running a simple program which turns on eight leds, first the ones in a even position and then the ones in a odd position, looping forever.

Run:
```
python blink-leds.py
```

which generates the image for the ROM in the file `program.bin`.  
Then connect the eeprom to the programmer and run:

```
minipro -p AT28C64B -w program.bin
```

## WIP

### Build assemly file with the cc65 compiler suite

#### Install cc65

```
git clone https://github.com/cc65/cc65.git
cd cc65
make
```
Move the generated binaries somewhere under $PATH.


#### Build blink.s

```
cl65 -C load.cfg --cpu 65C02 --no-target-lib blink.s
```

which builds the `blink` binary.


__Note__  
This binary should be exactly the same as the one generated by the python program

```
python blink-leds.py
cl65 -C load.cfg --cpu 65C02 --no-target-lib blink.s
```

compare with:
```
diff <(xxd ./blink) <(xxd ./program.bin)
```
which should return nothing (meaning the binary are the same).

#### Upload to mini pro

```bash
minipro -p AT28C64B -w blink
```

Push registers to stack: https://youtu.be/xBjQVxVxOxc?si=bFp7z4tenfyvrqtS&t=1049


Install minipro
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config git libusb-1.0-0-dev fakeroot debhelper dpkg-dev
git clone https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/minipro.git
cd minipro
make
sudo make install


sudo usermod -a -G plugdev YOUR-USER
```

attach the programmer to the laptop. Run the minipro --version, you should minipro recognizing the device:
```

### Disassemble
```
da65 --cpu 65C02 -g --comments 4 blink_subroutines | less

```

### Incremental levels of abstractions
Before we start. 6502 reads from `0x1ffc` (low byte) and `0x1ffd` (high byte) the address where to read the first instruction. We need to write at that address where that is. In this project, the first instruction is
at location 0 in the ROM, which is 0xE000 (1110000000000000) as seen by the CPU (see memory mapping)

- `blink-leds.py` creates the binary by specifing the 6502 instructions in binary. No assembler.
The program does not RAM. It blinks without a wait, so run it with a slow clock. The python script creates
a binary that exactly fits the rom and sets the address `0x1ffc` and `0x1ffd` to 0xE000
- `blink.s` it's the assembly version of the previous program. 
- `ram_test.s` is the first program that needs a ram to be installed. It verfies the ram works by storing something in ram and reading it back
- `blink_subroutines.s` runs the blink program with subroutines. This requires a ram since the `RTS` function (return sub routine) needs to know where to return to. This info is stored in the stack by the `JSR` (jump sub routine). The assemply also use `PHX` and `PLX` (push/pull x register to stack) to showcase how a subroutine can avoid interfere with registers being set outside of the subroutine.

### Compiling C
```
cp ~/github/cc65/lib/supervision.lib ~/github/8-bit-computer/leds_in_c/

ca65 --cpu 65C02 io.s

ca65 --cpu 65C02 crt0.s
ar65 a supervision.lib crt0.o
cc65 -t none --cpu 65C02 main.c
ca65 --cpu 65C02 main.s
ld65 -C load.cfg -o kernel.bin -vm crt0.o io.o main.o supervision.lib
minipro -p AT28C64B -w kernel.bin
```
